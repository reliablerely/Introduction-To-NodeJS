# Introduction-To-NodeJS
In this project, Three HTML pages were created.
An HTTP server was created and the three HTML pages created were routed to the browser as clieant request.
This was done with two different ways, first using file system and path and second using data stream (as seen in the folder: UsingStreamToRoutePages).
